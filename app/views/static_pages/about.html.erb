<h5>Assignement:</h5>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
  In this project, youâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse 
  where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. 
  Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, 
  outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
